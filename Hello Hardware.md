Hello Hardware is a challenge which is based on Logic gates and there implementation in the microproccessor to display the flag

### Approach:

- We were supposed to give inputs in such a way that it produces a HIGH(one) as output. So I imply observed there are 4 input variables hence 16 different types(2^4) of types of inputs possibles, hence i gave each and every value in the arduino and got the flag.
