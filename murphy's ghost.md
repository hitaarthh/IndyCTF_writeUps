### Approach:

- In this challenge we were provided with two files, one was the ``cipherText`` file and the other was the ```key``` to that cipherText.

- The cipherText sound file was a morse code and the key was found by viewing the given key.wav in spectrogram.
- This ```COOPER``` is the key for the ciperText found in the morse code.
