<h1>4achan's favourite</h1>
</div>

### Description:
This surely isnt the first time you're seeing this.

### Approach: 
- Achan's favourite was the first wireless challenge i had ever solved.

- There was a sound file attached in the resources section and hence i download the <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">audacity audio editor</a> to analyse the given sound file.

- I viewed the given file .wav file in spectrogram.
